# Bootstrap Site with Two APIs

## The Overview:

I'm going to cobble together a site using Bootstrap, and talk to two different APIs. One of these I'd like to be google maps. It's supposed to be tricky, but it's also hugely useful and everywhere.

## Bootstrap:

KISS principles apply.

## APIs

### Google maps

Using Google maps begs the question of location. Clearly, whatever the second API is, it needs to be something with relevance to location. Maybe where an instagram picture is taken from? And is that creepy?

### API x

What's location based and important, that people are going to want to have access to?
* Restaurants
* Pictures
* Tweets
* Events near me
* Stores near me
* coffee near me
* maybe not a store, but something else?
